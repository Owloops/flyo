Deploy self-hosted applications to Fly.io with a single command. Pre-configured deployments for open-source tools with automated GitHub Actions workflows.

## Getting Started

Fork this repository or use it as a template:

1. Create your repository (fork or template)
2. Add `FLY_API_TOKEN` to repository secrets
3. (Optional) Add `ENVIRONMENT` secret for private environment suffix
4. Deploy via GitHub Actions or command line

The system parallelizes deployments across multiple workers automatically.

## Prerequisites

- [Fly CLI](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/) installed
- `make`, `jq`, and `envsubst` (standard tools)

Run `make doctor` to verify your setup.

**Tip**: Disable analytics warnings with `fly settings analytics disable`
